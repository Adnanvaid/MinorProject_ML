# MinorProject_ML

This repository contains my Minor Project in Machine Learning, where I have implemented and practiced both Supervised and Unsupervised learning algorithms using Python.

The project is structured to clearly separate different types of ML models and demonstrate their real-world use cases with proper data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
