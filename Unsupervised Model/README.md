# Problem Statement

SmartCart is a growing e-commerce platform serving customers across multiple countries. The company collected extensive customer data consisting of 2240 customer records and 22 attributes including demographics, purchase behaviour, website activity, and response.

Currently, SmartCart uses generic marketing and engagement strategies for all customers, without clearly understanding different customer behaviour patterns. This results in missed opportunities to retain high-value customers, delayed identification of churn-prone users, and inefficient marketing.

To solve this, SmartCart aims to build an intelligent customer segmentation system using unsupervised machine learning. The system will analyse historical customer transaction data and group customers into meaningful clusters based on purchasing behaviour, engagement levels, and loyalty indicators.

You are hired as an AI/ML engineer to develop this system using clustering algorithms to discover hidden patterns in customer behaviour and support data-driven decisions for personalised marketing and customer retention.
